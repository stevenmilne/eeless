## Eeless - LESS CSS for Expression Engine

1/22/13 : Added the ability to set LESS and CSS paths in your config.php file.

`$config['less_serverpath'] = "";`

`$config['css_serverpath'] = "";`

`$config['css_browserpath'] = "";`



_original Readme_

Very early version - working really well for what I need, but likely with rather too many TODO comments around to suggest relying on it just yet.
